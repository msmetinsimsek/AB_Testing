# AB_Testing

Facebook recently introduced a new bidding type, "average bidding", as an alternative to the existing bidding type called "maximumbidding". One of our customers, bombbambomba.com,
decided to test this new feature and wants to do an A/B test to see if averagebidding converts more than maximumbidding. The A/B test has been going on for 1 month and bombabomba.com is now waiting for you to analyze the results of this A/B test. The ultimate success criterion for Bombabomba.com is Purchase. Therefore, the focus should be on Purchasemetric for statistical testing.



In this data set, which includes the website information of a company, there is information such as the number of advertisements that users see and click, as well as earnings information from here. There are two separate data sets, the Control and Test group. These datasets are on separate pages of ab_testing.xlsxexcel. Maximum Bidding was applied to the control group and AverageBidding was applied to the test group.

* impression: Ad views count
* Click: Number of clicks on the displayed ad
* Purchase: The number of products purchased after the ads clicked
* Earning: Earnings after purchased products
